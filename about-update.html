<p>I'm Sruti Gupta, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in backend development. With solid expertise in Data Structures, OOPs, and core computer science concepts like Operating Systems and DBMS, I specialize in building scalable, efficient, and seamless digital solutions.
    <br><br>I enjoy tackling challenging problems, designing robust backend architectures, and creating full-fledged web applications that are both functional and high-performing. My journey has evolved from UI/UX design to a deep focus on development, allowing me to combine creativity with technical precision.
    <br><br>Alongside coding, my experience in content writing strengthens my communication skills, enabling me to explain complex technical concepts clearly through documentation, blogs, or project reports.
    <br><br>Currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology at UIT, Burdwan University, Iâ€™m eager to keep learning, experimenting, and contributing to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of technology.</p>
