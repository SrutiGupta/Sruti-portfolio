                <p>I'm Sruti Gupta, an enthusiastic tech explorer with a deep interest in Web Development and UI/UX Design. With a strong foundation in Data Structures, OOPs, and core computer science concepts like Operating Systems and DBMS, I enjoy building seamless digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.

                    <br>I'm always excited to work on meaningful projects where I can apply my problem-solving skills and design thinking. Whether it's crafting responsive web interfaces, diving into blockchain with Solidity, or collaborating on open-source tools, I bring energy, creativity, and a growth mindset to everything I do.
                 <br>Alongside my technical journey, I have a solid background in content writing â€” an ability that strengthens my communication skills and allows me to present complex ideas clearly and creatively. My expertise spans technical writing, copywriting, and social media content creation. I craft compelling narratives that engage audiences while maintaining brand voice and achieving marketing objectives.
                <br>Currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology at UIT, Burdwan University, I'm eager to keep learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what I can build.</p>
